\title{Timeset}
\description{
Many API calls accept timesets to specify the time ranges of data being
requested. Timesets can be specified with \code{epirange()}, as \code{Date} objects, or
with wildcards.
}
\details{
Timesets are not special R types; the term simply describes any value that
would be accepted by epidatr to specify the time value of an epidata query.
The allowed values are:
\itemize{
\item Dates: \code{Date} instances, integer-like values, or integer-like strings that
take the form YYYYMMDD.
\item Epiweeks: Integer-like values or integer-like strings that take the form
YYYYWW.
\item EpiRanges: A range returned by \code{epirange()}, or a list of multiple ranges.
\item Wildcard: The string \code{"*"}, which request all available time values.
}

Please refer to the specific endpoint documentation for guidance on using
dates vs weeks. Most endpoints support only one or the other. Some (less
commonly used) endpoints may not accept the \code{"*"} wildcard, but this can be
simulated with a large \code{epirange()}.

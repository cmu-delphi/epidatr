\description{
Creates a helper object that can use auto-complete to help find COVIDcast
sources and signals. The \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html}{COVIDcast endpoint} of
the Epidata API contains many separate data sources and signals. It can be
difficult to find the name of the signal you're looking for, so you can use
\code{covidcast_epidata} to get help with finding sources and functions without
leaving R.

The \code{covidcast_epidata()} function fetches a list of all signals, and returns
an object containing fields for every signal:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode {r}">}}\preformatted{epidata <- covidcast_epidata()
epidata$signals
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

If you use an editor that supports tab completion, such as RStudio, type
\verb{epidata$signals$} and wait for the tab completion popup. You will be able
to type the name of signals and have the autocomplete feature select them
from the list for you. Note that some signal names have dashes in them, so
to access them we rely on the backtick operator:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode {r}">}}\preformatted{epidata$signals$`fb-survey:smoothed_cli`
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

These objects can be used directly to fetch data, without requiring us to use
the \code{covidcast()} function. Simply use the \verb{$call} attribute of the object:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode {r}">}}\preformatted{epidata$signals$`fb-survey:smoothed_cli`$call("state", "pa",
                                              epirange(20210405, 20210410))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

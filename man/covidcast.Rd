covidcast(

  time_type,
  geo_type,
  time_values,
  geo_values,
  as_of = NULL,
  issues = NULL,
  lag = NULL

}
\arguments{
\item{data_source}{A character string representing a data source to query: (1) fb-survey; (2) jhu-csse; (3) google-symptoms; (4) doctor-visits; (5) quidel; (6) hhs.    For more information about each data source, see \url{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html}.}

\item{signals}{A character string representing signals from a specific source to query.    A list of available signals for each data source can be found in \url{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals}. Each data source may have different signals.}

\item{time_type}{Temporal resolution of the data.  Most signals are available at time_type = "day" resolution.  Some signals are only available at the time_type = "week" resolution.}

\item{geo_type}{Takes in the form epirange(startdate,enddate), where startdate and enddate are of the form YYYYMMDD (can be passed as string or numeric).}

\item{time_values}{A character string that specifies geographic location: (1) county; (2) hrr, hospital referral region; (3) hhs;  (4) msa, metropolitan statistical area; (5) dma, designated market areas; (6) state; (7) nation.  See \url{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_geography.html} for details on which types are available for each data source.}

\item{geo_values}{A character string that specified which geographies to return. "*" fetches all geographies.  To fetch specific geographies, specify their IDs as a vector or a list of strings.    More information can be found in \url{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_geography.html}.}

This is the documentation of the API for accessing the Digital Surveillance
Sensors (sensors) endpoint of the Delphiâ€™s epidemiological Note: this
repository was built to support modeling and forecasting efforts
surrounding seasonal influenza (and dengue). In the current COVID-19
pandemic, syndromic surveillance data, like ILI data (influenza-like
illness) through FluView, will likely prove very useful. However, we urge
caution to users examining the digital surveillance sensors, like ILI
Nearby, Google Flu Trends, etc., during the COVID-19 pandemic, because
these were designed to track ILI as driven by seasonal influenza, and were
NOT designed to track ILI during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The [Delphi `epidatr` package](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatr/) is an R front-end for the [Delphi Epidata API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/), which provides real-time access to epidemiological surveillance data for influenza, COVID-19, and other diseases. `epidatr` is built and maintained by the Carnegie Mellon University [Delphi research group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/).

Data is available for the United States and a handful of other countries at various geographical resolutions, both from official government sources such as the [US Center for Disease Control (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html), and private partners such as [Facebook](https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/08/26/covid-19-symptom-surveys-through-facebook/) and [Change Healthcare](https://www.changehealthcare.com/). The API stores a historical record of all data, including corrections and updates, which is particularly useful for accurately backtesting forecasting models.

`epidatr` is designed to streamline the downloading and usage of data from the Epidata API. The package provides a simple R interface to the API, including functions for downloading data, parsing the results, and converting the data into a tidy format. We also provide the [epiprocess](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiprocess) package for downstream data processing and [epipredict](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epipredict) for modeling.

Consult the [Epidata API documentation](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/) for details on the data included in the API, API key registration, licensing, and how to cite this data in your work. The documentation lists all the data sources and signals available through this API for [COVID-19](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html) and for [other diseases](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/README.html#source-specific-parameters).

**To get started** using this package, view the Getting Started guide at `vignette("epidatr")`.

## Get updates

**You should consider subscribing to the [API mailing list](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/delphi-covidcast-api)** to be notified of package updates, new data sources, corrections, and other updates.

## For users of the `covidcast` R package

`epidatr` is a complete rewrite of the [`covidcast` package](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/), with a focus on speed, reliability, and ease of use. The `covidcast` package is deprecated and will no longer be updated.

## Usage terms and citation

We request that if you use the `epidatr` package in your work, or use any of the data provided by the Delphi Epidata API through non-`covidcast` endpoints, that you cite us using the citation given by [`citation("epidatr")`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatr/dev/authors.html#citation). If you use any of the data from the `covidcast` endpoint, please use the [COVIDcast citation](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/authors.html#citation) as well. See the [COVIDcast licensing documentation](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_licensing.html) and the [licensing documentation for other endpoints](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/README.html#data-licensing) for information about citing the datasets provided by the API.

**Warning:** If you use data from the Epidata API to power a product, dashboard, app, or other service, please download the data you need and store it centrally rather than making API requests for every user. Our server resources are limited and cannot support high-volume interactive use.

See also the [Terms of Use](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/terms-of-use/), noting that the data is a research product and not warranted for a particular purpose.

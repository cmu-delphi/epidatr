# need to come up with some tests
# after everything else, make sure that epidatr_cache isn't defined in the global state
# use the existing examples to save, then load and compare the values
# make sure the md5 name is correct
# make sure that file/folder creation works as expected
# make sure the saves are in the right location, maybe load them the dumb way
